# MagicaVoxel

1. Export the model from MagicaVoxel using the 'Marching Cubes' option (mc).
2. Open the .ply model using MS 3D Builder application.
3. When 3D Builder opens, select 'Import Model'.
4. Click 'Save As' and save it in .obj format.  Two files should be created, a .mtl and a .obj.
5. Run Blender.
6. Import the .obj file just created.
7. Select the model in the scene, and fix its object properties (usually fixing the X rotation).
8. Export the .obj to a new file.
9. In your export folder, get the .obj file generated by Blender and the .mtl file generated by 3D builder.
10. Put both files into a .zip.
11. Upload the .zip to Mixamo and animate!

When Exporting to .OBJ:

Do not change the name of the save files.  MagicaVoxel saves the texture file names inside its .OBJ export, and is not flexible.

Zip up the .OBJ, .MTL, and .PNG files for export to Mixamo.
